# Login with Unstoppable + Improvements to "Ethereum Wallet Balance Checker"

## Ethereum Wallet Balance

An open source app I found is [Ethereum Wallet Balance](https://www.ethereumwalletbalance.com/) which displays a dashboard, breaking down the amount of Ether and ERC-20 tokens the wallet owns. I decided to add the ability to login with unstoppable, and easily check your own wallet balance, while still retaining full functionality of the app.
